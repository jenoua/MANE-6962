# MANE-6962 - Gas Turbine Emissions 
The repository contains the homework assignments and project files for RPI's MANE 6962 Machine Learning course. 

Project: For the project, I decided to pursue two objectives: 
(1) identify which variable best correlates with the generation of CO and NOx of gas turbine power systems and 
(2) attempt to see if the model can predict the systemâ€™s emissions.
